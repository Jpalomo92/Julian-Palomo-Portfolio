# Julian Palomo's Portfolio

## Description

In this project, I created a portfolio for myself to have available for potential employers.

The ultimate goal for myself is acquiring a role in devolopment or programming. When going through the hiring process, this portfolio will provide some insight on my background history as well as capabilities.  

The biggest challenge was not knowing the look of my portfolio that I was going for, but how to go about acheiving the look/aesthetic. The more experience that I'm gaining with CSS, I'm realizing that there are several paths that you can take to get the same result. 

After creating a wireframe on Google Slides to confirm the layout, I first focused on setting up the syntax for the html code.

Next was laying out the CSS stylesheet. I came across many things that I needed to take time reading documentation on, such as 
background images and headers. 

Of course this came with many bugs and going back to figure out which elements needed to be listed within eachother, and which 
classes and identifiers needed to be placed in a different element.

I have listed comments all throughout the stylesheet describing what each selector does.

I made sure to follow the guidelines and not go overboard with bells and whistles quite yet.
